# IRIS Flower prediction using Tensorflow
Today I want you to show how you can use the **Tensorflow** to train **Iris Dataset**, a model that can categorize data.
## IRIS Dataset
This is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful data set in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be simpler than iris data set to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.
The data set contains 50 records of 3 species of Iris:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

# API Description
## tf.contrib.learn
TensorFlow’s high-level machine learning API (tf.contrib.learn) makes it easy to configure, train, and evaluate a variety of machine learning models. In this tutorial, we’ll use **tf.contrib.learn** to construct a neural network classifier and train it on the **Iris data set** to predict flower species based on sepal/petal geometry.
